# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of the Web-Design-Challenge is to create a dashboard website using visualizations created in a past analysis. 

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The link to the dashboard is here:
